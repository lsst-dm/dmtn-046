                  data-driven science and database research
                  communities was organized in response to suggestions
                  at the first XLDB Workshop. The goal was to develop
                  common requirements and primitives for a
                  next-generation database management system that
                  scientists would use, including those from
                  high-energy physics, astronomy, biology, geoscience
                  and fusion, in order to stimulate research and
                  advance technology. These requirements were thought
                  by the database researchers to be novel and unlikely
                  to be fully met by current commercial vendors. The
                  two groups accordingly decided to explore building a
                  new open source DBMS. This paper is the final report
                  of the discussions and activities at the workshop.},
